bio: |
  I am a Data Scientist and Engineer. Alongside my professional work, I conduct independent research on the structural limits of relational systems. I study how division and cohesion arise as inevitable consequences of positional structure, and how coarse recognition renders certain relations only interval-inferable or fundamentally inexpressible.
